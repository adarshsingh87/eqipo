            voluntarily enter information into, or sign up for or request certain services from us on our Website.
            <br>
            <br>
            The only personal information Equipo Health obtains about individual users to its website is that supplied voluntarily

              <li>Our Website includes links that hyperlink to websites, platforms, and other services not operated or controlled by us.</li>
              <li>
                Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In: We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Website that allows you to “like” or “share” content

                information from the social network that you have authorized to share with us. Please note that the social network may
                independently collect information about you through the integration.
              </li>
              <li>
                Brand Pages and Chatbots: We may offer our content through social media. Any information you provide to us when you
                engage with our content is treated in accordance with this Policy. Also, if you publicly reference our Website on social
                media (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with equipohealth in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in
                connection with our Website.
              </li>
            </ul>
            Please note that when you interact with other entities, including when you leave our Website, those entities may
            independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by
            those entities remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your
            rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We
            encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
            <h3>NEWSLETTER SUBSCRIPTIONS</h3>
            From time to time, we provide information to our customers and potential customers in the form of electronic newsletters
            and similar updates. When you subscribe to these updates, you will be added to our mailing list and will receive
            announcements and information about us. These will be emailed to the address(es) that you provide when you subscribe.
            You may opt out of receiving these communications by following the “unsubscribe” instructions that are contained within
            the communications that we send to you.
            <h3>MINORS</h3>
            The website covered by this privacy policy is not intended for or targeted at children. Equipo Health will not knowingly
            collect and maintain personally identifiable information from children of age thirteen years or younger. If you are a
            parent or guardian and think that we have collected personal information from a child under the age of 13 through this
            website, please contact us.
            <h3>COMMUNICATION PREFERENCES</h3>
            Equipo Health may send commercial emails to you advertising our products and services. You can also subscribe to various
            product and service-specific communications on our websites. If you receive direct marketing email from us and wish to
            discontinue these mailings, you may unsubscribe at www.equipohealth.com/unsubscribe and/or in any unsubscribe opt-out
            method provided in the communications.
            <br>
            <br>
            Where allowed by applicable law, the unsubscribe options provided to you may not apply to communications primarily for
            the purpose of administering order completion, contracts, support, product safety warnings, software updates where you
            are provided with appropriate choice in accordance with applicable law, or other administrative and transactional
            notices, the primary purpose of which is not promotional in nature. This means that even if you opt-out of receiving
            direct marketing communications, we may still need to retain some of your personal information necessary to communicate
            with you on these topics where required for these purposes. We do not share your personal information obtained through
            this site for the purpose of third-party direct marketing.

                Liking, Sharing, and Logging-In: We may embed a pixel or SDK on our Website that allows you to “like” or “share” content
                on, or log in to, your account through social media. If you choose to engage with such integration, we may receive
                information from the social network that you have authorized to share with us. Please note that the social network may
                independently collect information about you through the integration.

                media (e.g., by using a hashtag associated with equipohealth in a tweet or post), we may use your reference on or in
                connection with our Website.

            independently collect information about you and solicit information from you. The information collected and stored by
            those entities remains subject to their own policies and practices, including what information they share with us, your
            rights and choices on their services and devices, and whether they store information in the U.S. or elsewhere. We
            encourage you to familiarize yourself with and consult their privacy policies and terms of use.
          <p class="sub-heading">NEWSLETTER SUBSCRIPTIONS</p>
